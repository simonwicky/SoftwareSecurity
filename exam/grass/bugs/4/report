Q1. What class of bug are you reporting?                            [1 point]
Format string vulnerability

Q2. Describe the bug:                              [3 points = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2]
a) Where is the bug?
File, line: logging.cpp:59
Function: Logging::logError

b) What capabilities does the bug give to the attacker? 
This bug allows the attacker to write to any arbitrary location.

c) What are the conditions under which the bug can be exploited, and describe
your exploit? 
The server must finish setup and be listening on port for commands from the client . A client must connect to the server, log in and issue the command put with a special crafted file. As part of logging, the server will print the content of the file on its console. This printf contains a format string vulnerability allowing the attack to write to any arbitrary location. 
NOTE : This exploit is subject to timing issue. It might not print "Global corrupted" if the server stops before receiving the full file

Q3. Describe the fix for the bug:                       [2 points = 0.5 + 1.5]
a) Can the vulnerability be mitigated through automated techniques?    
   If yes, explain.
   This vulnerability can be removed by changing the source code. Aslr provide a strong defense, as long as no addresses leak, making the arbitray write random. It will still crash the server, but it won't be targeted to a special location.

b) Describe a code-fix for the bug. This must correspond to the submitted patch.
	Provide a format string to the logging printf. For security, all similar vulnerability in logging.cpp will be patched.
