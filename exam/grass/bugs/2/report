Q1. What class of bug are you reporting?                            [1 point]
Arbitrary command execution

Q2. Describe the bug:                              [3 points = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2]
a) Where is the bug?
File, line: command.cpp:402
Function: grepCommand::exec

b) What capabilities does the bug give to the attacker? 
This bug allows the attacker to execute an arbitrary command.

c) What are the conditions under which the bug can be exploited, and describe
your exploit? 
The server must finish setup and listening on port for commands. The client must log in and execute the command "grep ';/usr/bin/grassexternal.py&#'". Due to no sanitizazion when preparing the grep command in command.cpp:402, the client can modify the command itself, to execute a command after the grep command.

Q3. Describe the fix for the bug:                       [2 points = 0.5 + 1.5]
a) Can the vulnerability be mitigated through automated techniques?    
   If yes, explain.
   This vulnerability can be mitigated either by changing the source code, of by restricting the allowed system calls of the server.

b) Describe a code-fix for the bug. This must correspond to the submitted patch.
Use execve instead of system, which allows to pass the argument separately and prevent the command execution.
