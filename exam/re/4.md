## Code

```c
void task(uint8_t* src, uint8_t* dst, uint64_t n){
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
	{
		dst[i] = src[i];
	}
}
```


## Description

The function copies the n first bytes of the source to the destination. The source and destination are passed as arguments `uint8_t*` and n is passed as a `uint64_t` argument. This functions has side-effect and thus no result.
