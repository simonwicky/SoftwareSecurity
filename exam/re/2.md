## Description

The function is searching for a value given a key in a binary search tree. A pointer to the root of the tree is passed as argument `(struct tree_node*)`. If the searched key matches the one in the root, the function returns the root's value as `int64_t*`. If the searched key is different, the fuction is recursively called in the corresponding subtree, until a leaf is reached, indicated by NULL pointers. A tree_node contains a key `(char*)` and a value `(int64_t*)` as well as pointers to its children `(struct tree_node*)`.  
NOTE: The value is assumed to be `int64_t*` for clarity. The actual library does not provide an explicit type, only a pointer to an 8 byte object.
