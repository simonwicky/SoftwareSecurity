## Code

```c
struct tree_node
{
	struct tree_node *lhs;
	struct tree_node *rhs;
	int32_t value;
};

int64_t task1(struct tree_node *root)
{

    if(!root)
    {
    	return 0;
    }

    int64_t lhs_result = task1(root->lhs);
    int64_t rhs_result = task1(root->rhs);
    int64_t result = root->value * root->value;

    result += lhs_result;
    result += rhs_result;

    return result;

```


## Description

The function calculates the sum of the square of all elements in a binary tree. A pointer to the head of
the tree `(struct tree_node*)` is passed as the argument. The functions recursively calls itself over the children of the current node until it reaches a leaf, indicated by NULL pointers. The result is aggregated and returned as `int64_t`. A tree node contains a value `(int32_t)` as well pointers to its children `(struct tree_node*)`.
