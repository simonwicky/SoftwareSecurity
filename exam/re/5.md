## Code

```c
int8_t task5(uint64_t dividend ,uint64_t divisor , int64_t* quotient, uint64_t* remainder){
	*quotient = 0;
	if (divisor == 0) {
		return 1;
	}

	while (divisor <= dividend) {
		dividend -= divisor;
		*quotient += 1;
	}
	*remainder = dividend;
	return 0;
}
```


## Description
This function computes the result of the quotient and remainder of dividend divided by divisor. If divisor is 0, the return value is set to 1, otherwise 0. Dividend and divisor are passed as `int64_t`, quotient as `int64_t*`, remainder as `uint64_t*`.  

Simply put, quotient = floor(dividend / divisor), remainder = dividend % divisor.
