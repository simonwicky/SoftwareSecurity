## Code

```
int64_t task3(int64_t base, uint64_t exponent){
    int64_t table[4] = {1, base, base*base, base*base*base};
    int64_t acc = 1;

    for (int i = 62; i >= 0; i-=2)
    {
        int index = 3 & (exponent >> i);
        acc = acc * acc * acc * acc;
        acc *= table[index];
    }
    return acc;
}
```


## Description

The function uses a fancy variant of a square and multiply algorith to exponentiate the first parameter `(int64_t)` by the second parameter `(uint64_t)`. The result is return as `int64_t`. The algorithm is basically a square-and-multiply but scaning two digits at a time. The table is used to store the first power of the base.
